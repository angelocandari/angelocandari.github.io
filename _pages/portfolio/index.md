I believe that data represents reality and it is my job to make that connection so that people can make smart decisions. I love statistics, python and working with people to find simple explanations to solve complex problems and to build systems to try predict what will happens next.

I use my skills in Python, Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn to clean and manipulate data for analysis. I utilize Machine Learning techniques to use data to train models to make predictions.  I love Math, Statistics and Probabilities that allows me to view complex problems objectively and solve them in a structured manner. I also have an uncanny ability to explain concepts simply and present insights intuitively by using data-driven visualizations such as Seaborn, D3.js, Qliksense and Google Data Studio dashboards.
